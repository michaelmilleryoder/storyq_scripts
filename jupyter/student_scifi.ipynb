Lilly and Leo always told the Pups how they found each other . Well , you \\'re probably wondering what we did with all those chickens . We put them in a basket and shipped them to a farm . There they were studied and some of them eventually got used to make some more cooked and fried chicken , but they all eventually went to chicken heaven . Let \\'s just hope nothing like that ever happens again . In the end we all became happy even if we did n\\'t get what we want .

Our jaws droped . We had no idea Rocco had a diffrent name . \"', '\" asked Leo . \"', '\" Guys , My name is n\\'t Rocco , It \\'s Dr. Larry , But you can just call me Larry . Our jaws dropped . We had no idea Rocco had a different name . \"', '\" asked Leo . \"', '\" Answered Larry . The puppies where all over the place but once I called them to come over to see Uncle Larry they all ran straight to him and jumped on top of Larry . Larry was on the floor after the puppy attack laughing as the puppies licked his face . I noticed that each dog had their own little superpower just like Lilly and Leo . They could understand us perfectly after being born just a week or two ago . We \\'d tell them stories about how we saved New York City . Lilly and Leo always told the Pups how they found each other . Well , you \\'re probably wondering what we did with all those chickens . We put them in a basket and shipped them to a farm . There they were studied and some of them eventually got used to make some more cooked and fried chicken , but they all eventually went to chicken heaven . Let \\'s just hope nothing like that ever happens again . In the end we all became happy even if we did n\\'t get what we want . What \\'s important is that it \\'s all over and we can go back to living our not so normal lives . \"', '\" There was about 5 puppies 3 girls and 2 boys . The girls were named Mia , , and . The boys were , and Benjie , They were the sweetest little pups but let me tell you , Bath time with the Uncles is n\\'t a good choice . These guys might not be my real family , but they were all I had , so I loved them more than anything . hat studies weather and natural disasters . \"', '\" Pups why do nt you all say your names so Uncle Danny can hear them . \"']]   \n",

Lilly and Leo always told the Pups how they found each other . Well , you \\'re probably wondering what we did with all those chickens . We put them in a basket and shipped them to a farm . There they were studied and some of them eventually got used to make some more cooked and fried chicken , but they all eventually went to chicken heaven . Let \\'s just hope nothing like that ever happens again . In the end we all became happy even if we did n\\'t get what we want .

And they got to a rocket ship take off space and they got in the ship and hit lauch .,  When they were in space they saw the Earth , it was so polluted and flooded that it just looked like a brown pool of trash . It took a few hours but they still made it to Phobos . The planet most of the humans were . When &lt;character name=\"Joel_that_red_liquid\"&gt;he&lt;/character&gt; got there &lt;character name=\"Joel_that_red_liquid\"&gt;he&lt;/character&gt; almost got attacked by a guy in a brown suit .,  But before &lt;character name=\"Joel_that_red_liquid\"&gt;he&lt;/character&gt; could hit Joel Joel pulled out &lt;character name=\"Joel_that_red_liquid\"&gt;his&lt;/character&gt; laser gun .

They could understand us perfectly after being born just a week or two ago . We \\'d tell them stories about how we saved New York City . Lilly and Leo always told the Pups how they found each other . Well , you \\'re probably wondering what we did with all those chickens . We put them in a basket and shipped them to a farm . There they were studied and some of them eventually got used to make some more cooked and fried chicken , but they all eventually went to chicken heaven .

The puppies where all over the place but once I called them to come over to see Uncle Larry they all ran straight to him and jumped on top of Larry . Larry was on the floor after the puppy attack laughing as the puppies licked his face . I noticed that each dog had their own little superpower just like Lilly and Leo . They could understand us perfectly after being born just a week or two ago . We 'd tell them stories about how we saved New York City . Lilly and Leo always told the Pups how they found each other . Well , you 're probably wondering what we did with all those chickens . We put them in a basket and shipped them to a farm . There they were studied and some of them eventually got used to make some more cooked and fried chicken , but they all eventually went to chicken heaven . Let 's just hope nothing like that ever happens again . In the end we all became happy even if we did n't get what we want . What 's important is that it 's all over and we can go back to living our not so normal lives . \", \" There was about 5 puppies 3 girls and 2 boys . The girls were named Mia , , and .

Lilly and Leo always told the Pups how they found each other . Well , you \\'re probably wondering what we did with all those chickens . We put them in a basket and shipped them to a farm . There they were studied and some of them eventually got used to make some more cooked and fried chicken , but they all eventually went to chicken heaven . Let \\'s just hope nothing like that ever happens again . In the end we all became happy even if we did n\\'t get what we want .

       "1   [“Bahhh” “I don’t speak sheep.” Joel said./ “I said my name is Joey.” /“WAIT WATCH OUT!” At that moment Joel saw a car on fire hurdling towards them./ At the exact moment, Joel saw the car, he grabbed Joey and ducked./ Five minutes later. “Joey, Joey Where are you.” /“I ‘m over here” joey said in a very faint voice./ “Help I got stuck under the car” Joel started running towards Joey’s screams for help./ When found the car he saw a red liquid and he thought the worst, that joey had gotten seriously injured or worst died. /So he pushed the car with all his might and he got it off joey. /“Joey are you okay, are you bleeding? /“No why would you think that?’’/ “Because there is a red liquid all over you.” /“You really think that’s blood ha ha YOU JUST GOT PRANKED.” /“What, what do you mean.” /“Joel that red liquid is my jelly I keep with me.”/ “You’re so funny Joey” Joel said in a sarcastic way./,  After walking for about one hour and we saw a lot of turned over buses and cars. /After that they stopped and Joel asked “Joey I never got the chance to ask where we are.”/ “Um give me a second to think about it.” Said Joey/ “I think we’re on Earth.” /“Earth?” “I have never heard of that planet.” /“Well I think we’re on it.”/ So after Joel asked that question they kept walking for about three hours and we had finally reached the town of Whiterun. /And then we saw a fort. /So Joel put Joey over the wall and was trying to climb the wall himself./ But then a guard with a spoon stopped Joel. /“Why are you trying. to climb the wall, sunny boy?” /“I’m sorry I didn’t know?”/ “Well it doesn’t matter.,  You’re going to jail.”/ After the guard put Joel in jail. Joel felt that he would never get out of jail. But then, Joey walked up to the jail cell and unlocked it.,  /“Joey how did you get to me?” Joel said.,  /“Hurry up.” Joey said./ “But, never mind.” /Joey and Joel ran as fast as they could and they made it to a dessert./ After they made it to the desert they went to sleep for the night.,  /Little did he know he was on a island. /While was on the island he was so desperate for Joey company. /After searching the island for a couple hours he found a boat. /He took the boat to shore and was in the city Megaton and he found a farm and went in it. /Then he found Joey the weird sheep./ And they got to a rocket ship take off space and they got in the ship and hit lauch./,  When they were in space they saw the Earth,it was so polluted and flooded that it just looked like a brown pool of trash./ It took a few hours but they still made it to Phobos.

Larry was on the floor after the puppy attack laughing as the puppies licked his face . I noticed that each dog had their own little superpower just like Lilly and Leo . They could understand us perfectly after being born just a week or two ago . We 'd tell them stories about how we saved New York City . Lilly and Leo always told the Pups how they found each other . Well , you 're probably wondering what we did with all those chickens . We put them in a basket and shipped them to a farm . There they were studied and some of them eventually got used to make some more cooked and fried chicken , but they all eventually went to chicken heaven . Let 's just hope nothing like that ever happens again . In the end we all became happy even if we did n't get what we want . What 's important is that it 's all over and we can go back to living our not so normal lives . \", \" There was about 5 puppies 3 girls and 2 boys . The girls were named Mia , , and .

The puppies where all over the place but once I called them to come over to see Uncle Larry they all ran straight to him and jumped on top of Larry . Larry was on the floor after the puppy attack laughing as the puppies licked his face . I noticed that each dog had their own little superpower just like Lilly and Leo . They could understand us perfectly after being born just a week or two ago . We 'd tell them stories about how we saved New York City . Lilly and Leo always told the Pups how they found each other . Well , you 're probably wondering what we did with all those chickens . We put them in a basket and shipped them to a farm . There they were studied and some of them eventually got used to make some more cooked and fried chicken , but they all eventually went to chicken heaven . Let 's just hope nothing like that ever happens again . In the end we all became happy even if we did n't get what we want . What 's important is that it 's all over and we can go back to living our not so normal lives . \", \" There was about 5 puppies 3 girls and 2 boys . The girls were named Mia , , and .

Joel felt that he would never get out of jail. But then, Joey walked up to the jail cell and unlocked it.,  /“Joey how did you get to me?” Joel said.,  /“Hurry up.” Joey said./ “But, never mind.” /Joey and Joel ran as fast as they could and they made it to a dessert./ After they made it to the desert they went to sleep for the night.,  /Little did he know he was on a island. /While was on the island he was so desperate for Joey company. /After searching the island for a couple hours he found a boat. /He took the boat to shore and was in the city Megaton and he found a farm and went in it. /Then he found Joey the weird sheep./ And they got to a rocket ship take off space and they got in the ship and hit lauch./,  When they were in space they saw the Earth,it was so polluted and flooded that it just looked like a brown pool of trash./ It took a few hours but they still made it to Phobos.

Psics must make a machine to help <character name=\"Ok_Said_Mark\">Mark</character> . <character name=\"Said_Psics\">Psics</character> thought about an oxygen tank Psics needed to make the oxygen tank quick . Psics made the oxygen tank in surprisingly 30 seconds ! After all he does have 8 legs . He quickly put the oxygen tank on <character name=\"Ok_Said_Mark\">Mark</character> . <character name=\"Ok_Said_Mark\">Mark</character> felt relieved . Psics and <character name=\"Ok_Said_Mark\">Mark</character> decided to explore the shipwreck to find weapons like swords and well - waterlogged pistols .

What they did not know was that the ship belonged to a great pirate that could only die if he touched water that pirate would perish that day when his ship was boarded and sank from the other ships cannonballs . \" Maybe we can find soggy bread ” <character name=\"Ok_Said_Mark\">Mark</character> asked doubted . \" What is bread Mark \" Psics questioned . \" Bread is something us humans eat . \" \" Oh us aliens eat well only rocks it 's our diet . \" \" We could find bread but probably just like us we do n’t like wet rocks and you most likely do n’t like wet bread . \" \" It s better to have wet bread than nothing \" said <character name=\"Ok_Said_Mark\">Mark</character> . Let s explore that shipwreck . \" Mark I found a crate \" Psics exclaimed . \" We should open it <character name=\"Ok_Said_Mark\">Mark</character> , ” said <character name=\"Said_Psics\">Psics</character> . \" Wait look to the right Psics it 's a room somehow completely intact ” . \" I think that is suspicious . \" Let s open the door .

There was a blue girl in the corner of the room . Wait wait do not shoot I am on your side ! The blue girl said . What how are you on our side ? <character name=\"Ok_Said_Mark\">Said Mark</character> . How do you know about us ? How are you on our side ? Well I am the god of the sea . Wow really ? <character name=\"Said_Psics\">Said Psics</character> . I m just an inventor ... Well you would help as an inventor against the invading aliens . I brang the aliens to earth ? <character name=\"Ok_Said_Mark\">Said Mark</character> . Well since I am the god of sea I want the sea to be safe these aliens will mess up the sea by first giving the sea pollutants and ... HEY said <character name=\"Said_Psics\">Psics</character> . I thought you were on our side ! You are . Said the blue girl . I mean 1 alien does not effect water but there is at least 125 aliens up there . Well now that I can continue with what i was going to say the aliens may ... Well if you are on our side . <character name=\"Ok_Said_Mark\">Mark</character> said . What is your name ? My name is ... her voice trailed off the sea god . With all due respect but that is not a name . Let s call <character name=\"Said_Wave\">her Wave</character> ! <character name=\"Said_Psics\">Psics</character> suggested . <character name=\"Said_Psics\">It</character> has to do with water . Yes that will be my name said <character name=\"Said_Wave\">Wave</character> . Now since i can hopefully continue again who knows maybe the aliens will use their lazer beams and make the water evaporate so either way we must terminate these aliens except <character name=\"Said_Psics\">Psics</character> I guess . First I am hungry . <character name=\"Ok_Said_Mark\">Said Mark</character> . Well that crate had bread It 's been 15 hours since I have ate anything . Only 15 hours ? <character name=\"Said_Psics\">Said Psics</character> . We Octosai must wait 18 hours 33 minutes and 14 seconds for each rock . <character name=\"Ok_Said_Mark\">Ok ..... Said Mark</character> . Meanwhile at planet Tentaclus . It appears that <character name=\"Said_Psics\">Psics</character> had betrayed us . <character name=\"Said_King_Tentaclus\">King Tentaclus</character> said . <character name=\"Said_King_Tentaclus\">You</character> Octosai simply must find Mark and <character name=\"Said_Psics\">Psics</character> . Boss our tracking devices can not find them underwater . Said Legodon the leader of the alien troop . How do <character name=\"Said_King_Tentaclus\">you</character> know he is underwater ? <character name=\"Said_King_Tentaclus\">King Tentaclus</character> said .

Tank just attacked our best and most skilled man and seem to have been riddled with bullets , and if that ca n’t even put a dent in him we do n’t stand any chance if there ever was any in the first place . In the many rare cases of seeing him run ramped you can see he has changed as if somehow his injections and the cloning process have mutated him adding to his already scar riddled body .\n",

February , 15 transmission 543\n",
       "14    The team has been gathered around the janitorial closet about two hours now and all barrels pointed with itchy trigger fingers waiting for something to pop out and attack . Tank has started whispering to himself and crying about all the sins and wrong he has done in his life and all the people he killed . We started to contemplate if we should knock on the door and reasonably talk this out . When we touched the door opened and everyone just froze Dempsey was just standing there with tears running down his face and swinging back and forth . I just thought to myself our one and only successful experiment and we are going to have to put him down like a dog . We have put him in shackles meant to hold bears and dangerous predators but he could probably rip them apart with a single pull . He has so far been muttering to himself , before we shackled him up he said he wanted to talk and that ’s all he has said .\n",

We have all been taking shifts watching Dempsey , and everyone has been on edge . Most people have not even gone to sleep and have been talking about how we are even going to get him out of here . The only thing they do not know about this project is that they are secretly sedated and teleported down in the transporter in the untouched area . That is the only reason the area is not used so they do not find out the truth .\n",

We have started to pack up to escort tank to the transporter , right before we finished packing up he has stared to finally talk . He said that we should sit down because this was going to be a long confession . When he started talking about how he regretted all things he has done and how he felt bad for the people he has killed . We all scoffed at this idea but then he started talking about his family and friends and conspiracies but we all did n’t believe him .\n",
