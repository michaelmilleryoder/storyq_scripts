Psics must make a machine to help <character name=\"Ok_Said_Mark\">Mark</character> . <character name=\"Said_Psics\">Psics</character> thought about an oxygen tank Psics needed to make the oxygen tank quick . Psics made the oxygen tank in surprisingly 30 seconds ! After all he does have 8 legs . He quickly put the oxygen tank on <character name=\"Ok_Said_Mark\">Mark</character> . <character name=\"Ok_Said_Mark\">Mark</character> felt relieved . Psics and <character name=\"Ok_Said_Mark\">Mark</character> decided to explore the shipwreck to find weapons like swords and well - waterlogged pistols . Finally mark found a sword , which meant they both had weapons . \n",

What they did not know was that the ship belonged to a great pirate that could only die if he touched water that pirate would perish that day when his ship was boarded and sank from the other ships cannonballs . \" Maybe we can find soggy bread ” <character name=\"Ok_Said_Mark\">Mark</character> asked doubted . \" What is bread Mark \" Psics questioned . \" Bread is something us humans eat . \" \" Oh us aliens eat well only rocks it 's our diet . \" \" We could find bread but probably just like us we do n’t like wet rocks and you most likely do n’t like wet bread . \" \" It s better to have wet bread than nothing \" said <character name=\"Ok_Said_Mark\">Mark</character> . Let s explore that shipwreck . \" Mark I found a crate \" Psics exclaimed . \" We should open it <character name=\"Ok_Said_Mark\">Mark</character> , ” said <character name=\"Said_Psics\">Psics</character> . \" Wait look to the right Psics it 's a room somehow completely intact ” . \" I think that is suspicious . \" Let s open the door .

There was a blue girl in the corner of the room . Wait wait do not shoot I am on your side ! The blue girl said . What how are you on our side ? <character name=\"Ok_Said_Mark\">Said Mark</character> . How do you know about us ? How are you on our side ? Well I am the god of the sea . Wow really ? <character name=\"Said_Psics\">Said Psics</character> . I m just an inventor ... Well you would help as an inventor against the invading aliens . I brang the aliens to earth ? <character name=\"Ok_Said_Mark\">Said Mark</character> . Well since I am the god of sea I want the sea to be safe these aliens will mess up the sea by first giving the sea pollutants and ... HEY said <character name=\"Said_Psics\">Psics</character> . I thought you were on our side ! You are . Said the blue girl . I mean 1 alien does not effect water but there is at least 125 aliens up there . Well now that I can continue with what i was going to say the aliens may ... Well if you are on our side . <character name=\"Ok_Said_Mark\">Mark</character> said . What is your name ? My name is ... her voice trailed off the sea god . With all due respect but that is not a name . Let s call <character name=\"Said_Wave\">her Wave</character> ! <character name=\"Said_Psics\">Psics</character> suggested . <character name=\"Said_Psics\">It</character> has to do with water . Yes that will be my name said <character name=\"Said_Wave\">Wave</character> . Now since i can hopefully continue again who knows maybe the aliens will use their lazer beams and make the water evaporate so either way we must terminate these aliens except <character name=\"Said_Psics\">Psics</character> I guess . First I am hungry . <character name=\"Ok_Said_Mark\">Said Mark</character> . Well that crate had bread It 's been 15 hours since I have ate anything . Only 15 hours ? <character name=\"Said_Psics\">Said Psics</character> . We Octosai must wait 18 hours 33 minutes and 14 seconds for each rock . <character name=\"Ok_Said_Mark\">Ok ..... Said Mark</character> . Meanwhile at planet Tentaclus . It appears that <character name=\"Said_Psics\">Psics</character> had betrayed us . <character name=\"Said_King_Tentaclus\">King Tentaclus</character> said . <character name=\"Said_King_Tentaclus\">You</character> Octosai simply must find Mark and <character name=\"Said_Psics\">Psics</character> . Boss our tracking devices can not find them underwater . Said Legodon the leader of the alien troop . How do <character name=\"Said_King_Tentaclus\">you</character> know he is underwater ? <character name=\"Said_King_Tentaclus\">King Tentaclus</character> said . There is a touch of green stuffwhich is what they used to make their ship land here . Well then send 3 Octasai to the aproximate landing site .

Today our new test subject has arrived from the surface world his name is Tank Dempsey . Tank Dempsey is one of the strongest soldiers on the surface which now is a post-apocalyptic wasteland of sorts . Tank has significant legends about him , one of them is how it take more than 100 50 . Caliber rounds to even bring him down to his knees . We have gone through all of his documents and he has more than 250 confirmed kills and 1000 possible kills . He has also gone m.i. a more than 30 times and has always come back with more kills . He has just started to wake up and getting very aggressive and resisting to cooperate .\n",

Tank just attacked our best and most skilled man and seem to have been riddled with bullets , and if that ca n’t even put a dent in him we do n’t stand any chance if there ever was any in the first place . In the many rare cases of seeing him run ramped you can see he has changed as if somehow his injections and the cloning process have mutated him adding to his already scar riddled body .\n",

We have all gathered together in the laboratory to make preparations in case we actually capture tank . We have now returned to the area where our best guard was brutally and savagely murdered by a man with his bare hands even thought he was armed with suffice armor and weaponry . We started examining the body and right off the bat we saw that the victim ’s entire leg was ripped from his body and only a few feet away with things such as his calf gone and no trace of it to be found . We had to think he has resorted to cannibalism .\n",

       "14    The team has been gathered around the janitorial closet about two hours now and all barrels pointed with itchy trigger fingers waiting for something to pop out and attack . Tank has started whispering to himself and crying about all the sins and wrong he has done in his life and all the people he killed . We started to contemplate if we should knock on the door and reasonably talk this out . When we touched the door opened and everyone just froze Dempsey was just standing there with tears running down his face and swinging back and forth . I just thought to myself our one and only successful experiment and we are going to have to put him down like a dog . We have put him in shackles meant to hold bears and dangerous predators but he could probably rip them apart with a single pull . He has so far been muttering to himself , before we shackled him up he said he wanted to talk and that ’s all he has said .\n",
