You just have to get used to its shortcomings. It is fast, and provided apps make it easy to move downloaded apps to the SD card (32 GB included!).

       "19908  A great tablet, with a few exceptions. Compared to current models, this tablet is thick and heavy. Also, the screen is dim, and too reflective. If you want to watch a movie in low light, the screen acts like a mirror and all you can see is your face. As strange as it sounds with these complaints, I like the tablet, everything else is great. You just have to get used to its shortcomings. It is fast, and provided apps make it easy to move downloaded apps to the SD card (32 GB included!). Its screen ratio is perfect for movie watching, no black bars like on my 4:3 ratio iPad Mini 4. I would buy again and recommend.   \n",
