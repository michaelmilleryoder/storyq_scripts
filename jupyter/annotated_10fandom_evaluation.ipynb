Psics must make a machine to help <character name=\"Ok_Said_Mark\">Mark</character> . <character name=\"Said_Psics\">Psics</character> thought about an oxygen tank Psics needed to make the oxygen tank quick . Psics made the oxygen tank in surprisingly 30 seconds ! After all he does have 8 legs . He quickly put the oxygen tank on <character name=\"Ok_Said_Mark\">Mark</character> . <character name=\"Ok_Said_Mark\">Mark</character> felt relieved . Psics and <character name=\"Ok_Said_Mark\">Mark</character> decided to explore the shipwreck to find weapons like swords and well - waterlogged pistols . Finally mark found a sword , which meant they both had weapons . \n",

What they did not know was that the ship belonged to a great pirate that could only die if he touched water that pirate would perish that day when his ship was boarded and sank from the other ships cannonballs . \" Maybe we can find soggy bread ” <character name=\"Ok_Said_Mark\">Mark</character> asked doubted . \" What is bread Mark \" Psics questioned . \" Bread is something us humans eat . \" \" Oh us aliens eat well only rocks it 's our diet . \" \" We could find bread but probably just like us we do n’t like wet rocks and you most likely do n’t like wet bread . \" \" It s better to have wet bread than nothing \" said <character name=\"Ok_Said_Mark\">Mark</character> . Let s explore that shipwreck . \" Mark I found a crate \" Psics exclaimed . \" We should open it <character name=\"Ok_Said_Mark\">Mark</character> , ” said <character name=\"Said_Psics\">Psics</character> . \" Wait look to the right Psics it 's a room somehow completely intact ” . \" I think that is suspicious . \" Let s open the door .

There was a blue girl in the corner of the room . Wait wait do not shoot I am on your side ! The blue girl said . What how are you on our side ? <character name=\"Ok_Said_Mark\">Said Mark</character> . How do you know about us ? How are you on our side ? Well I am the god of the sea . Wow really ? <character name=\"Said_Psics\">Said Psics</character> . I m just an inventor ... Well you would help as an inventor against the invading aliens . I brang the aliens to earth ? <character name=\"Ok_Said_Mark\">Said Mark</character> . Well since I am the god of sea I want the sea to be safe these aliens will mess up the sea by first giving the sea pollutants and ... HEY said <character name=\"Said_Psics\">Psics</character> . I thought you were on our side ! You are . Said the blue girl . I mean 1 alien does not effect water but there is at least 125 aliens up there . Well now that I can continue with what i was going to say the aliens may ... Well if you are on our side . <character name=\"Ok_Said_Mark\">Mark</character> said . What is your name ? My name is ... her voice trailed off the sea god . With all due respect but that is not a name . Let s call <character name=\"Said_Wave\">her Wave</character> ! <character name=\"Said_Psics\">Psics</character> suggested . <character name=\"Said_Psics\">It</character> has to do with water . Yes that will be my name said <character name=\"Said_Wave\">Wave</character> . Now since i can hopefully continue again who knows maybe the aliens will use their lazer beams and make the water evaporate so either way we must terminate these aliens except <character name=\"Said_Psics\">Psics</character> I guess . First I am hungry . <character name=\"Ok_Said_Mark\">Said Mark</character> . Well that crate had bread It 's been 15 hours since I have ate anything . Only 15 hours ? <character name=\"Said_Psics\">Said Psics</character> . We Octosai must wait 18 hours 33 minutes and 14 seconds for each rock . <character name=\"Ok_Said_Mark\">Ok ..... Said Mark</character> . Meanwhile at planet Tentaclus . It appears that <character name=\"Said_Psics\">Psics</character> had betrayed us . <character name=\"Said_King_Tentaclus\">King Tentaclus</character> said . <character name=\"Said_King_Tentaclus\">You</character> Octosai simply must find Mark and <character name=\"Said_Psics\">Psics</character> . Boss our tracking devices can not find them underwater . Said Legodon the leader of the alien troop . How do <character name=\"Said_King_Tentaclus\">you</character> know he is underwater ? <character name=\"Said_King_Tentaclus\">King Tentaclus</character> said . There is a touch of green stuffwhich is what they used to make their ship land here . Well then send 3 Octasai to the aproximate landing site .
