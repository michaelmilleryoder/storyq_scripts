       "'Taking issue with Joseph Schumpeter, who saw late capitalism’s “disintegration of the bourgeois family” as part of a broader “decomposition” of collective life, Klinenberg nevertheless exemplifies Schumpeter’s famous definition of a “civilized man” (in distinction to a “barbarian”) as one who recognizes the “relative validity” of his “convictions” while being able to “stand for them unflinchingly.” On those terms, Klinenberg is a civilized man indeed. His only false note for this reader — though hardly an exception to his civility — is his willingness to give HERE IT ISserious consideration to the use of robots as companions for the aged. But even here his intelligence allows him no more than a formal bow (“By the time the current generation of young adults reaches old age, their comfort with machines will make robotic companions even more attractive”) as opposed to the groveling prostration often observed in the presence of the All-High Tech. With unassailable judgment he says that “questions raised by critics” like me “should be directed at all of us, not merely at artificial intelligence researchers.” The same might be said of the HERE IT ISissues raised by social researchers — and Klinenberg says it.'"
